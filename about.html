<p>I am a software engineer, and a DevOps dude, always trying to fill the gap between development and IT operations. Actually making life better for each side of the fence, and tear down that fence, which usually leads to a better team and greater productivity.</p>

<p>I like to spend most of my "work" time on <a href="http://www.docker.io">Docker</a> and Docker related stuff, combined with <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html">Continuous Delivery</a> and
    <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continuous Integration</a>.</p>

<p>While seeking the best solution for the problem at hand, I always try keep an open mind. I am a fan of open source, and yes, I have my list of favourites :-).</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to paraglide the skies with my MacPara Eden 5.</p>
